# Code of Conduct

Hello valued community members! üëã

Our Conductor community has grown tremendously, and as part of ensuring a harmonious experience for everyone, 
we've outlined some guidelines that we'd love for all members to uphold. 
Our community thrives when everyone engages with kindness, respect, and a collaborative spirit. Here's what we hope to see:


### 1. Maintain a Positive Tone.  
Every interaction is an opportunity to lift someone up. Let's ensure our words and actions reflect optimism and encouragement.

### 2. Be Respectful to the Community
Every member here comes with a unique background and perspective. Please honor those differences by being courteous, considerate, and open-minded. 
Remember, mutual respect is the foundation of a thriving community. Be careful in the words that you choose. 
We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. 
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors aren't acceptable. 
This includes, but is not limited to:
* Violent threats or language directed against another person  Discriminatory jokes and language
* Posting sexualized language or imagery
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (‚Äúdoxing‚Äù)
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

### 3. Preserve Our Community's Unity
We understand that as we grow, there might be differing opinions and interests. 
However, we kindly request not to create splinter groups or fork out the community. 
Let's work through our differences and continue building this space together.

### 4. Focus on Constructive Discussions
We all have moments of frustration, but let's express ourselves in ways that are constructive. 
Avoid comments that could come off as sarcastic, condescending, or disdainful. 
Remember, it's always possible to give feedback or express disagreement without belittling others.
We are here to learn from each other and make Conductor the best platform out there. 
A big part of that are the exchanges of ideas and approaches that are grounded in data and sound reasoning. 
We kindly request that you adhere to that pattern and be thoughtful and responsible in your discussions. 
This also means that you are required to have discussions focused on the community and not on promotion of any services, products or goods.

### 5. When we disagree, try to understand why.
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and this community is no exception. 
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. 
Remember that we‚Äôre all different. The strength of this community comes from its varied community of people from a wide range of backgrounds. 
Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre wrong. 
Don‚Äôt forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn‚Äôt get us anywhere. 
Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
Our community's strength lies in our collective spirit. 
By following these guidelines, we ensure that our community remains an inspiring, respectful, and welcoming place for everyone. 
If you have any concerns or suggestions or if you need to report on any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please feel free to reach out to the admins - community@orkes.io. 
Let's continue to support and uplift each other!
